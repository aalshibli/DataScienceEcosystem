# Data Science Ecosystem with Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides an overview of the Data Science Ecosystem, including popular programming languages, libraries, and tools used in the field. The notebook covers the following topics:

- Introduction to Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
- Popular programming languages for Data Science (e.g., Python, R, SQL)
- Commonly used libraries in Data Science (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Open-source Data Science tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Apache Spark)
- Arithmetic expression examples in Python
- Conversion of units (minutes to hours)
- Key objectives and takeaways from the course

The repository serves as a practical exercise in creating and sharing Jupyter Notebooks, which are widely used in the Data Science community. It also demonstrates the use of Markdown cells for documentation and formatting, as well as code cells for executing Python code.
